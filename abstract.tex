\section{ABSTRACT}

The recent hike in the availability of cheap sensing technologies and powerful
mobile computing machinery has fueled the development of fully autonomous
vehicles, thus transforming the transportation industry towards a more safe and
accessible environment. The motivation of this report is to present a general
overview of the fundamental components of such a system - Perception
(responsible for tasks such as localization, static obstacles mapping, moving
obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection
and recognition), Planning (route planning, path planning, behavior selection,
motion planning, etc.) \& Control. It starts with a timeline, discussing the
development of self-driving cars since the DARPA challenges. The later part of
this report presents a review on the various ethical and moral issues which
arise with the advent of self-driving cars.
